Motor Glory is a simple game for MS-DOS. It started life as a demake of
Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots, but has been reworked to remove
any copyrighted materials. At the moment it is rather bare bones,
but it is designed to be fairly easy to expand.

To build, install & configure [Open Watcom](http://openwatcom.org/)
and ensure the wbin folder is on your system path.

Once it is configured, simply type:

    > wmake
    
In the same folder as the *MAKEFILE*.

At present, any new compilation units created will need to be added
to the MAKEFILE to go with the others present there.
